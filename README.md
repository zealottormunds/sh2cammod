Thanks for downloading my SH2 Camera Mod!

**Changelog v1.0:**
- OTS Camera Mod
- First Person Camera Mod
- Manual Aiming Mod
- Observation Deck and Restroom Map Fixes (More might be coming)

Special thanks to:
- Phillip Trudeau for his incredible SH2 Map Editor.
- The Enhanced Edition team for making the best version of the game. I wouldn't have modded this game otherwise.
- Bawkbasoup, Just Happy Burger, JSTRETCH, Silent Archives, Razor9809, TommyMyers-PNG, Nokoshow, and all of those who have spread the word about my mods.
- All of you who have played my mods, donated me and shared my work.
- Lin Min for the Dll Wrapper that I used.

**Instructions:**
Drag and drop all the files from the .rar into your SH2 root folder. Replace if prompted. This is compatible with SH2 Enhanced Edition. To open the mod menu, pause the game with ESC and then press F1. This only works when your game is paused. Any errors, crashes or softlocks you find, let me know. Also, I've added F2 as the hotkey to switch the camera mod ON/OFF while you're in game. Use it if you don't wanna go into the mod menu.

**This mod works with:**
- SH2 Enhanced Edition
- Silent Hill 2 v1.0 No-CD Patch

**2D controls will be forced when the mod is enabled!**

**Mod menu controls**
- F1 to enable/disable
- ESC to go back
- Enter to turn a setting ON/OFF
- WASD to navigate

Also some of you have told me you wanna tip me so I won't say no, here's my paypal crap if you wanna do it (it's not necessary, this mod is free, only do this if you wanna waste money): [Paypal crap in case you wanna waste money](https://www.paypal.me/zealottomato)
