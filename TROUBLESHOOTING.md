## How do I use a gamepad with this?
In the mod settings, check the "enable gamepad" option. Keep in mind that this will ignore your mouse input!

## The right stick of my gamepad doesn't work, what can I do?
If you're using the enhanced edition, you need to play around with this option:

Try both XInput and DirectInput, and see which one works for you!

## My game crashes after enabling the mod with F2
Make sure that you have either the SH2 Enhanced Edition installed (highly recommended) or the Silent Hill 2 v1.0 English No-CD Patch. Those are the executables that work with the mod.

## The mod works as intended but I'm getting random crashes.
Try disabling the collision of the camera (F1 -> Aim Settings -> Use Camera Collision). In my experience, sometimes the collision system doesn't like the positioning of the camera and it causes a crash.

## I'm using a Steam Deck but the game won't boot at all with the mod. What can I do?
I'm looking into this at the moment!
